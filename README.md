Cybersecurity Bootcamp Project 1
This repository contains sample work from my stuides with University of Oregon’s Cybersecurity Bootcamp. Over 6 months, the class has covered 5 Divisions (Offense, Defense, Network, and Linux/Windows); and 6 Domains (Threats/Attacks/Vulnerabilities, Risk Management, Tools, Access Management, Architecture/Design, and Cryptography) of Cybersecurity.  
The BASH Script provide a micro view of the course. The scripts help manage system info. While scripting isn’t completely necessary for the field, the course has emphasized a strong reliance on the fundamental aspects of using code to automate simple system analysis.
The YML Script displays exposure to the creation and utilization of virtualized environments. Specifically using DOCKER to Configure VMs as well as installing and launching applications. 
The Networking Diagram provides th macro view of the program. This particular diagram was part of our exploration architecture and design, building secure virtual networks within Microsoft Cloud Management Systems.
